**Fundamentals of Supervised Learning**

In supervised learning, algorithms learn from a set of training data that includes both input features (like genetic markers, clinical parameters, and patient demographics) and known output labels (such as treatment responses). The goal is to develop a model that can predict the output for new, unseen data <!--[if supportFields]><span

By predicting how individual patients will respond to specific treatments, clinicians can tailor therapies that are likely to be most effective, improving patient outcomes. Algorithms can also help identify which combinations of treatments are most effective, based on patient data, and advance early detection of cancers, potentially identifying at-risk patients earlier than traditional methods <!--[if supportFields]><span

role of machine learning (a part of artificial intelligence—AI) in the
diagnosis and treatment of various types of oncology is steadily increasing. It
is expected that the use of AI in oncology will speed up both diagnostic and
treatment planning processes. This review describes recent applications of
machine learning in oncology, including medical image analysis, treatment
planning, patient survival prognosis, and the synthesis of drugs at the point
of care. The fast and reliable analysis of medical images is of great
importance in the case of fast-flowing forms of cancer. The introduction of ML
for the analysis of constantly growing volumes of big data makes it possible to
improve the quality of prescribed treatment and patient care. Thus, ML is
expected to become an essential technology for medical specialists. The ML
model has already improved prognostic prediction for patients compared to
traditional staging algorithms. The direct synthesis of the necessary medical
substances (small molecule mixtures) at the point of care could also seriously
benefit from the application of ML. We further review the main trends in the
use of artificial intelligence-based technologies in modern oncology. This
review demonstrates the future prospects of using ML tools to make progress in
cancer research, as well as in other areas of medicine. Despite growing
interest in the use of modern computer technologies in medical practice, a
number of unresolved ethical and legal problems remain. In this review, we also
discuss the most relevant issues among

**Case Study: Application in NSCLC Treatment**

In the case of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), supervised learning has been utilized to predict patient responses to treatments, particularly regarding genomic variants that influence response to immunotherapy. This case study focuses on developing predictive models that classify patients as responders or non-responders based on their genomic profiles. Features derived from these genomic variation profiles were used to train supervised learning models, such as logistic regression and decision trees. The target was to categorize patients according to their treatment response, enabling targeted therapeutic strategies.

The predictive model demonstrated high accuracy in classifying treatment responses, which can significantly aid clinicians in deciding the most appropriate therapeutic approaches for individual patients. Furthermore, the identification of specific genetic markers associated with positive responses helps in understanding the biological mechanisms underlying treatment effectiveness <!--[if supportFields]><span
